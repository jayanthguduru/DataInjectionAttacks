# DataInjectionAttacks
Predictive Maintenance (PdM) systems, leveraging advanced Machine Learning technologies, play a crucial role in preempting equipment failures, thereby mini￾mizing downtime and extending equipment lifespan. Our project delves into the
vulnerability of PdM systems when subjected to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, a critical concern in the era of Industry 4.0. We concentrate our efforts on assessing the robustness of Deep Learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in their ability to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery when faced with such challenging conditions. The project encompasses the modeling and application of two distinct types of data injection attacks : Biased Data Injection Attack and Random Data Injection Attack, targeting turbofan engine sensor data. Our evaluation critically examines the impact of these attacks on the predictive ac￾curacy of CNN, LSTM, and GRU models within PdM systems. The findings reveal that even a few compromised IoT sensors through FDI attacks can significantly impair the RUL prediction across all models, highlighting a critical area of concern in the reliability and security of PdM systems
